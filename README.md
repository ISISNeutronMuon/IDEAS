Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility Support for facility software

## Introduction

This repository will act as a source of information and advice to developers and colleagues in the UKRI STFC ISIS Neutron and Muon Facility for creating and supporting an inclusive, diverse and accessible community structure.

The aim is to share advice, ask and answer questions, and distribute our collective insight and experience and uncourage us to learn from each other while improving the accessibility and inclusivity of our software and services.

## Participation

Please remember this site, forums and any uploaded content is covered by the [UKRI Code of Conduct](https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/UKRI-081020-CodeOfConduct.pdf).

### N.B.

It is inevitable that any broader discussion of diversity and inclusion will engage with groups and issues beyond each individual's personal history or familiarity. Consequently, all participants are encouraged to remember the following points.

- No amount of research replace first-hand experience.
- Discussion may touch on situations affecting other participants, their relatives, or partners.
- Endeavour to speak to, rather than for, groups affected by concerns regarding inclusivity, diversity, equity or accessibility.
- Solicit engagement with, and participation of, effected groups and individuals where possible and appropriate.

_Finally_

- The goal is to enhance the experience of using our facilities and services for _everyone_, there is no other metric explicit or implied.
